I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 1945, in script
    "([mcname] stands with her thumb out in a hitchhiker’s gesture. Then, she stretches out her leg and raises the hem of her skirt over her calf. The director raises an eyebrow. Filming ceases.)"
NameError: name 'mcname' is not defined
